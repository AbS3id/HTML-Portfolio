<h1>The Best Movies According to Mohamad AlHasan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
<p>This is my Favourite anime. It captures that sensation of waking up from a dream you wish lasted longer, or misplacing a name that's still warm on your tongue, & I love the Beautiful images.</p>
<h3>Drunken Master - The Beginning</h3>
<p>This is the 1st movie I watched for Jackie Chan, he made me fall in love with Kong Fu. It's a mixture of martial arts and funny scenes.</p>
<h3>Mulan - 1998</h3>
<p>This is my Favourite Disney Movie of all time. I've seen it a hundred times & still inspiring.</p>
